# Salesforce Lightning Lookup component

It all started with a need to have a Lookup in a flow.

A search lead me to [Jitendra Zaa's blog](https://www.jitendrazaa.com/blog/salesforce/embed-lightning-component-in-flow/) and several articles he had put together on a simple but effective Lookup Lighting Component that could get pulled into a flow.  Be sure to check out his other articles.  He has some great stuff.

I then went about updating it and adding several features that I needed.
